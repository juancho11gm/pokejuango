Some months ago I was crossing the border between Colombia and Ecuador. I was traveling from Pasto üá®üá¥ to Quito üá™üá® with my partner.

We wanted to work remotely for some weeks. That was a long road, 7 hours traveling overland in a public bus. I thought we were "wasting" time while moving around, and we had more tips ahead of us. So we decided to buy a book in Quito, so we would make the most of time while moving from one place to another.

That was the beginning of a change of mentality that would turn our lives around. We started to read other types of books that would help us boost our careers. In both personal and professional life.

Recently I finished one of the books that changed my mind: [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits). I realized that working on a side project that complements your career will help you to achieve your goals easier. By setting goals, moving forward step by step, tracking the small victories... I'm sure I will shape my personal and professional career by writing a blog.

Right now I'm in the Goldilocks zone, I'm in the perfect place to keep my motivation high up. By creating this blog, I'll avoid boredom and I'll work on interesting topics that are adapted to the difficulty I am looking for.

I'm a Web Developer, and I think I have valuable insights that could help in both technical and soft skills areas. I've participated in different kinds of projects that helped me to gain experiences that I can share with my teammates. I want to save those tips, bug fixes, findings, and interests in my personal blog, so I can practice different skills, like writing and coding.

I'll share posts about coding (JavaScripts, React, NextJS, GSAP among others), books, trips, and so on. Whatever thing I find useful to share. Hope you enjoy it.

This 2022 has been an amazing year where I had to adapt to new environments in in every respect, so many learnings to highlight. So I'll be sharing my experiences in the areas described above.

Let's see how it goes :).
